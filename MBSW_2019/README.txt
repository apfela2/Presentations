# This is a presentation I gave at the Midwest Biopharmaceutical Statistical Workshop (MBSW) in May 2019.

# We present 2 case studies of applying innovative statistical methods to address challenging questions about biomarkers.
# One study focus on pharmacodynamic analyses of biomarkers, and the second on combinations of biomarkers to predict patient outcomes.

# The first study consisted of RNA-seq data for ~18,500 genes, for multiple time points from 18 subjects with advanced cancer
# who received one of three different doses of therapy, on one of two different schedules.
# We sought to identify top genes with dose-dependent changes in expression over time, while adjusting for batch effects.
# We also sought to help select a dose based on the results from this analysis.

# The second study used data from an oncology clinical trial comparing two treatment arms consisting of 183 subjects.
# We aimed to identify a composite biomarker that could help predict patient outcomes:
# Best Overall Response, Progression-Free Survival, or Overall Survival - in one of the treatment arms.
# In this analysis we compared effect size estimates and predictive performance metrics for multiple candidate models.
